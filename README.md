## Today I learned

Every day we learn something new, a hack, some workaround, something that saves time, makes you more efficient.

Unfortunately we forget it sooner than time it took to learn, and we will have to repeat and spend same amount of time, when similar situaton pops next time!

So this is an attempt to capture and retain such daily discoveries in a concise way. Like an index of hard references to memory locations in the heap so that it won't get garbage collected ;)
